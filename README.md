# Quater-Imaginary_Numbers

Hello! I'm glad to hear you're interestin gin experimenting with base 2i

Under Quater-Imaginary_Numbers > src > Number_Systems are two classes. Complex is used to represent decimal complex numbers, and QImag represents numbers in base 2i.

Both classes have a convert_to_[other class] for easy conversions between the two classes. There is also arithmetic operations in each class. QImag only adds and subtracts as of yet, but I encourage you to play around with how numbers can be represented in each class.

I also reccomend keeping your numbers under 100,000 (decimal) as rounding errors will start to occur in the QImag conversion. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [my website.](https://keegankresge.com/contact-me/)
